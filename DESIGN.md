===================

> This is the link to the Lab Description: 
[Lab - RPS](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/spring16/classwork/02_design_rps/index.php)

Initial Design
=======

###Weapon

* General class for each weapon, doesnâ€™t store what it beats/what beats it
* Knows weapon display attributes

###WeaponSet

* Stores all of the weapons the Player can use

###Rules

* Rule set decides what beats what- game gives it 2 weapons and it decides on the winner based on its info

###Player

* Creates player, attaches weapon selected, and maintains win/loss for player

###Game

* Runs game after creating x players, uploading data file for game, and populating the weapon set

Use Cases
=======

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```
